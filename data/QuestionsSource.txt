For each personality trait, based on the analysis in `personalityEDA.ipynb`, the questions that had the most evenly distributed responses were identified.
Having evenly distributed responses makes it easier to differentiate people (vs if most people strongly agreed/disagreed with something). 
Some statements were edited so that agreeing with it meant plus points for that trait.

AGR6: I have a soft heart.
